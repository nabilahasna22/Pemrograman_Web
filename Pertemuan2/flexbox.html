            <p>The Oompa Loompas come from Roald Dahl's 1964 children's classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and appear in the book's 1971 and 2005 movie adaptions. They are a diminutive people with peculiar hairstyles who work in Willy Wonka's fanciful chocolate factory. They sing songs throughout the story, particularly detailing the shortcomings and mistakes of each child that comes to the chocolate factory in a special visit in the story.
            Perhaps the most memorable presentation of the Oompa Loompas was in the 1971 film adaption Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, starring Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. In this incarnation, the Oompa Loompas were played by short-statured actors wearing orange body paint and green wigs, with their eyebrows painted white. In the film, the Oompa Loompas open their first song with the now iconic lyrics: "Oompa loompa doompa-de-doo / I have a perfect puzzle for you."
